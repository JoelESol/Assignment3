According to Baddeley, working memory describes [[Short Term Memory]] as a system with multiple components. It consists of the [[Phonological Loop]], the [[Visuospatial Sketchpad]] and the [[Central Executive]] (and later the [[Episodic Buffer]]). These memory components work together with the variety of memory types. In terms of physical computers this would be equivalent to RAM as it is dynamic, constantly updating and rearranging depending on what is being thought about.

Memory consolidation is the process of transferring [[Short Term Memory|short-term memories]] into [[Long Term Memory|long-term memories]]. Short-term memory is very limited and can only store information for about 30 seconds before being forgotten, so important information must be moved to long-term through [[Short Term Memory#Consolidation|consolidation]]. This process of moving from short-term to long-term increases the stability of the memory and makes it more resistant to interference and decay.

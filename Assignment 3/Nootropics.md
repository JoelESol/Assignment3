Nootropics are pharmacological agents designed and consumed for the sole purpose of cognitive augmentation. Most are psychiatric drugs being used in an off-label capacity, but in general they include any psychoactive compounds shown to enhance cognitive function. Nootropics that enhance memory in particular include [[Caffeine]], taurine, nicotine, and sage. Most of these substances predominantly enhance memory encoding processes, allowing memories form to persist for longer periods of time with higher accuracy, and they have also been shown to influence memory retrieval. Pharmaceuticals with nootropic properties related to memory include [[Piracetam]], Modafinil, as well as Adderall, which is used in a nootropic capacity mainly by students attempting to improve their performance. Most of these drugs do not directly enhance memory; they instead enhance other cognitive processes, such as memory retrieval, that may later appear to support memory.

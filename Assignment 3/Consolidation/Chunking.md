Chunking, or grouping, is a technique used to help memorization by grouping smaller pieces of information into larger, easier to remember groups. According to Miller's Law the average number of units a person can remember is 7 (+/- 2). Grouping smaller things into a single unit will make remembering easier.

For example, remembering a phone number. A phone number is usually 10 digits long which is already above the average of 7. If the phone number is 1234567890 we could group it as 123, 456, 7890, essentially giving us 3 units to remember instead of 10.

You can also group by categories. If you are grocery shopping you can group items that are related, like fruits, vegetables, dairy, or grains

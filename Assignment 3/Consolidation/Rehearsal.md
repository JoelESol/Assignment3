Rehearsal or rather maintenance rehearsal is the repetition of information with the intent of memorizing it. It can be mentally thinking about it and repeating the information in your mind or verbally speaking and repeating the information. However, just repeating information without any meaningful thoughts or connections does not usually transfer to long-term memory. This is often used to keep information in short-term memory until it is stored somewhere else or is no longer useful.

For example repeating a list of groceries while shopping until you have each item, or repeating a phone number until you store it in your phone or on paper.

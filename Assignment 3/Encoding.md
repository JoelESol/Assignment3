Encoding is the process of converting and storing information into our memory system. When sensory information is received from our environment, the brain categorizes it with similar information and concepts. There are 3 types of encoding: Semantic, Visual and Acoustic.

Semantic Encoding can be described as encoding the meaning of the information. New information is linked to existing knowledge and experiences.

Visual Encoding involves processing visual details of information such as colour, shape, and or 3d spatial arrangement.

Acoustic encoding relates the auditory aspects of information such as sound, rhythm, words and other stimuli.

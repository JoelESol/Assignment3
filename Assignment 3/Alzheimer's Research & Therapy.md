Cognitive complaints in the absence of objective cognitive impairment, observed in patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), are common in old age. The first step to postpone cognitive decline is to use techniques known to improve cognition, i.e., cognitive enhancement techniques.

Background:
SCD refers to individuals who perceive a decline in cognitive abilities without objective evidence. Even though not included in major diagnostic manuals, the presence of SCD and the possibility that it may precede neurodegenerative disorders warrants research attention. Interventions targeting this group can potentially reduce the risk of future cognitive decline and dementia. The paper suggests the creation of "Brain Health Services" to address the cognitive needs of this population.

Cognitive, Mental, or Physical Training (CMPT):
CMPT interventions aim to impact cognition through various methods like cognitive exercises, physical activity, and mental training such as mindfulness meditation. Recent studies on SCD showed positive effects of CMPT not only on cognition but also on well-being and quality of life. Among CMPT interventions, those based on repeated practice (e.g., video games or mindfulness meditation) were found to significantly improve attention and executive functions. In contrast, strategic learning was effective in improving objective memory.

Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation:
NIBS techniques like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulate brain activity and can influence cognition. While there's evidence suggesting that NIBS combined with cognitive training can enhance cognitive function in the aging population, high variability across studies makes it challenging to offer consistent recommendations. The potential of NIBS is promising, but more well-designed, comprehensive trials are needed to ascertain its efficacy.

The review examined cognitive-enhancing drugs and herbal extracts, such as Panax ginseng, Gingko biloba, and Bacopa monnieri, for their impact on cognition in SCD individuals. Based on the evidence, there was no compelling reason to recommend these drugs or extracts for cognitive enhancement in SCD or worried-well individuals. Any potential effects from herbal extracts are subtle and vary based on several factors.

Conclusions:
The research on cognitive enhancement techniques for the SCD population shows promise, particularly for CMPT. While more research is needed on drugs and NIBS, CMPT interventions, including mindfulness meditation, are recommended due to their harmlessness, cost-effectiveness, and ease of implementation.

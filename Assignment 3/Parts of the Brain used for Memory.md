There are many different parts of the brain associated with memory and its various different types.
The [[Phonological Loop]] is commonly associated with Broca's Area which is found in the left cerebral hemisphere and is in an area associated with language as well as the Pre-frontal Cortex and Posterior Parietal Cortex.
[[Working Memory]] engages prefrontal and parietal regions of the brain associated with verbal and numerical tasks.
[[Explicit Memory]] specifically memories that include general knowledge and autobiographical experiences are stored in the hippocampus-medial temporal lobe system.
[[Implicit Memory]] involving skills, habits and motor-skills are stored in the amygdala.
[[Chunking]] also termed an episodic buffer is suggested to be localized in the hippocampus.

The method used to determine which areas of the brain are involved with specific memory types has been done by performing psychological testing on individuals affected by disorders. Lesions that effect specific locations in the brain cause disorder which can be mapped with an MRI which can then be linked to a particular cognitive defect.

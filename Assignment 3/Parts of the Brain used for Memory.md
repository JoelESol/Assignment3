There are many different parts of the brain associated with memory and its various different types.
The [[Phonological Loop]] is commonly associated with Broca's Area which is found in the left cerebral hemisphere and is in an area associated with language as well as the Pre-frontal Cortex and Posterior Parietal Cortex.
[[Working Memory]] engages prefrontal and parietal regions of the brain associated with verbal and numerical tasks.
[[Explicit Memory]] specifically memories that include general knowledge and autobiographical experiences are stored in the hippocampus-medial temporal lobe system.
[[Implicit Memory]] involving skills, habits and motorskills are stored in the amygdala.
[[Chunking]] also termed an episodic buffer is suggested to be localized in the hippocampus.

Memory is the capacity for brains or machines to manipulate information either for storage or retrieval. This is an essential part of cognition that enables learning, calculation, behaviour and who you are as a person.

There are several different subprocesses that make up the cognitive process of  memory such as [[Encoding]], [[Consolidation]], [[Recovery]], and [[Reconsolidation]]. These subprocesses are the different ways that information can be manipulated in our brains.

There are several different subcategories of memory such as [[Short Term Memory]], [[Long Term Memory]], and  [[Phonological Loop]].

Memory doesn't just happen in a single portion of the brain

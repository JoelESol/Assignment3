Memory is the capacity for brains or machines to manipulate information either for storage or retrieval. This is an essential part of cognition that enables learning, calculation, behaviour and who you are as a person.

There are several different subprocesses that make up the cognitive process of  memory such as [[Encoding]], [[Consolidation]], [[Recovery]], and [[Reconsolidation]]. These subprocesses are the different ways that information can be manipulated in our brains.

The causes of memory loss can be attributed to genetics and lifestyle choices. A healthy diet, regular exercise, not smoking, and maintaining normal blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels can help protect memory. Mental activity is also important, as it can strengthen mental skills and memory just like physical exercise strengthens muscles.

Memory is defined as the ability to recall information and can be categorized into short-term and long-term. Short-term memories are transient and are quickly discarded as they become irrelevant. Long-term memories, which include facts, events, skills, and processes, are more durable and form the essence of our identity, but they can also change over time.

Memories are stored across different areas of the brain; [[Parts of the Brain used for Memory]]. The hippocampus logs the components of a memory, while the amygdala marks them as important or emotionally powerful. These components are then stored in the cerebral cortex. When retrieving a memory, the frontal lobes focus attention and pull the memory pieces from the cerebral cortex. This involves coordinating data from various brain regions to reconstruct the memory, whether it's visual, linguistic, or auditory information, thus forming a unique neuronal pattern that is reactivated during remembering.

There are several different subcategories of memory such as [[Short Term Memory]], [[Long Term Memory]], and  [[Phonological Loop]].

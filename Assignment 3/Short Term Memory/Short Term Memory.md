Short-term memory, also known as primary or active memory, refers to the cognitive system responsible for storing small amounts of information for a short time. For example, remembering a person's phone number or address. Short-term memory has a limited capacity and duration of around 7 items (Miller's Law) and 30 seconds, respectively. It is also highly susceptible to interference and decay causing most information to be lost before being transferred to [[Long Term Memory]].

Short-term memory is often associated with [[Working Memory]]. However, working memory refers more to the manipulation of information in short-term memory, usually during decision making, or problem solving, and has a larger expanded model as proposed by Baddeley.

To assist short-term memory there are some techniques to transfer information to long-term through [[Consolidation]]

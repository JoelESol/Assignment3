The visuospatial sketchpad handles visual and spatial information. Visual information refers to images of objects and how they look and spatial refers to relative location of objects and oneself. The sketchpad can also retrieve and display information from long term memory. For example, when you are asked how something looks you find yourself picturing that thing and describing it.

The Phonological loop is a component in Baddeley's [[Working Memory]] model. This component is responsible for temporary storage of roughly 2 seconds called the phonological store which contains speech based information. This loop allows individuals to store this verbal or auditory information which allows activities such as practicing or rehearsing what you might say.

For example the phonological loop would be used for remembering a telephone number right before dialing by repeating it over and over.

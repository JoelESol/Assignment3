A relationship has been demonstrated between habitual intake and cognitive performance. The following [study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hup.218) by Borota et al. found a significant relationship between habitual caffeine intake (via coffee or tea) and higher long-term memory performance. The study consisted of screening applicants for habitual caffeine intake and having them engage in intensive cognitive testing. The study found that caffeine did not counteract age-related cognitive decline or short term memory. Habitual caffeine intake was also found to improve long term memory in a [study involving rats](https://www.scielo.br/j/bjmbr/a/Tb7ymZdLYv5mjTbjNy3KgsP/?lang=en), which saw rats trained to find a platform in a water maze performed better if they consumed caffeine after their training sessions. These rats performed better than ones who consumed caffeine before the training, suggesting that memory retention was enhanced by the substance, as opposed to memory acquisition.
Other studies, however, have found positive, negative, or no effects of immediate caffeine intake on long term memory, and so the general status of caffeine's memory augmentation properties remains contested.

Perhaps the most commonly used method of augmenting and supporting memory is the mnemonic device, which consists of devising a strategy to improve memory encoding. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn988) of superior memorizers at the World Memory Championships showed that individuals with outstanding memory abilities did not exhibit structural brains differences, but instead had essentially trained themselves to use spatial memory strategies. Many of these memorizers used the strategy of the *Mind Palace* first practiced by the ancient Greeks, which involves placing objects to be remembered around the mental image of an imagined "palace" or environment. By imaging themselves walking through the palace and seeing the objects, the individual is able to more effectively recall the desired items. These techniques showed elevated activity in the hippocampal regions of the brain, which are vital to memory. Although they require extensive practice to unlock their maximal memory enhancement potential, mnemonics offer a reliable method of supporting and strengthening memory that is accessible to any brain, even those that are already memory impaired. Some Mnemonics are listed below.
### Acronyms
An acronym is an abbreviation formed from the first letters of other words.

For example ROYGBIV. This acronym is used to represent the colors of the rainbow in order. R is Red, O is orange, and so on.
### Rhymes
Rhyming words or sentences can also help you remember information.

For example, remembering how to turn a screw, "righty tighty, lefty loosey". 
### Method of Loci
Method of Loci, also known as a memory palace, uses visualization of familiar locations or environments to support memory recall. This is often done by visualizing a room and placing memories in various places like on a book shelf, or associating an item in the room with a memory.

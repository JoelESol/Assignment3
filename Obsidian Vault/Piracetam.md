Piracetam is a derivative of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) used in the treatment of dementia, vertigo, dyslexia, and other cognitive disorders. It is credited as the [first nootropic](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1527-3458.2005.tb00268.x?sid=nlm%3Apubmed) and has been shown to enhance memory in humans. A [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00426834) in 1976 found that after taking 400mg of the substance daily for 14 days, subjects saw a significant increase in verbal recall. Piracetam was first synthesized in the earely 1970's by Belgium scientist Dr. Corneliu Giurgea, who coined the term *nootropic* and realized that this drug intended to treat motion sickness actually enhanced memory and focus in healthy individuals by increasing cerebral blood flow.
